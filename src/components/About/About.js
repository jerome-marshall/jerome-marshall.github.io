                  Hello! My name is Jerome and I enjoy creating things that live
                  on the internet. My interest in Android and Web Development
                  started back in 2017 when I decided to create a meme app â€”
                  turns out a meme app taught me a lot about development and
                  digital experiences.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Fast-forward to today, I've had the privilege to train myself
                  in various bleeding-edge technologies to create amazing
                  digital experiences. Currently, I'm working at Cognizant as a
                  Program Analyst. But as development has become my passion, I'm
                  obliged to get smarter every day. So when the opportunity
                  arises, I could make the best use of my skills.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

                  {skillSet &&

                      <li key={i}>
                        <span>{skill}</span>
                      </li>
                    ))}
                </ul>
