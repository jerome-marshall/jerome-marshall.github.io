                Hello! My name is Jerome and I enjoy creating things that live
                on the internet. My interest in Android and Web Development
                started back in 2017 when I decided to create a meme app â€” turns
                out a meme app taught me a lot about development and digital
                experiences.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Fast-forward to today, I've had the privilege to train myself in
                various bleeding-edge technologies to create amazing digital
                experiences. Currently, I'm working at Cognizant as a Program
                Analyst. But as development has become my passion, I'm obliged
                to get smarter every day. So when the opportunity arises, I
                could make the best use of my skills.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
